# Try and Code This!

#### A challenge for those who already have experience in HTML/CSS (inspired by cs 498 RK)

### Rules:

* no external libraries (bye bootstrap)
* Only use HTML and CSS
* The different colored sections must be both horizonally and vertically centered at all times(no matter what the screen size is)
* Styling must be only css
* Image should have a height and width of 150px;
* You **may** use different colors and change the information in the profile
